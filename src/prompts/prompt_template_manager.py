# A disclosure standard is a formalized set of requirements that prescribes what information must be reported, how, sometimes when, and often for whom.
# A disclosure topic is a specific sustainability-related risk or opportunity based on the activities conducted by organization within a particular industry as set out in a disclosure standard.
# An organization refers an entity that is required, or chooses, to prepare general purpose financial statements and climate disclosure.
# A partner external organization or stakeholder that collaborates with a company to advance sustainability goals, initiatives, or disclosures.
# A business model is an organization’s system of transforming inputs through its activities into outputs and outcomes that aims to fulfil the organization’s strategic purposes and create value.
# A governance is a system, process, control, and procedure by which an organization monitors, manages, and oversees climate-related risks and opportunities.
# A strategy covers how organization’s business model and strategy are or will be affected by climate-related risks and opportunities.
# A risk is climate-related risks that could reasonably be expected to affect an organization’s cash flows, access to finance, or cost of capital, over short, medium or long term.
# An opportunity is a potential positive effect of climate change on the organization.
# A resource use is consumption of natural resources, such as energy, water, raw materials, and land.
# A target is climate-related goal set by the organization for mitigating or adapting to climate risks, or for capturing climate opportunities.
# An initiative is a specific activity, program, or project undertaken by an organization to achieve its climate-related objectives.

An entity is legal or reporting organization, an academic or political institution or a commercial company.

A plan is defined set of actions, milestones, and timelines describing how an entity will achieve its goals.
A resource refers to an input that supports an entity’s operations.
A standard is a specification or performance criterion used to guide or measure practices, metrics, or disclosures.
An event is a discrete occurrence with environmental, financial, or operational implications related to climate
An environmental impact is an effect that an entity’s activities, products, or services have on the natural environment.
A location is a place on Earth, a location within Earth, a vertical location, or a location outside of the Earth.
A methodology is a defined analytical or computational approach to assess resources or impact.
